        <h2>The Breeding and Initial Development of Sichuan Cuisine</h2>
        <p>Sichuan cuisine has sprouted since the Shang and Zhou dynasties. Before the Shang Dynasty, the Bashu area had been able to make exquisite pottery food utensils. People already have time to care about the aesthetics of the food utensils, and they can develop handicrafts in addition to farming, which means that they have sufficient food and a relatively stable life, and they already have a certain basis for diet.</p>
        <p>During the Qin, Han, Wei, Jin, Southern and Northern Dynasties, Sichuan cuisine was born in its first form. In order to consolidate Qin's rule in Bashu, King Hui of Qin began to immigrate to Bashu during his reign. During the period of King Zhao of Qin, Li Bing was the governor of Shu County and built the Dujiangyan Water Conservancy Project. After Qin Shi Huang unified the whole country, he once again immigrated to Sichuan on a large scale. These measures have greatly promoted the development of the local economy and the exchange of food culture, and provided an essential material and cultural foundation for the development of Sichuan cuisine.</p>
        <p>Sichuan cuisine in the Three Kingdoms period already had some specialties, such as fish dishes. Today's Sichuan dishes are rarely sweet, and Sichuan people don't like sweet food, but at that time, people would add honey to the meat to enhance the taste.</p>
        <h2>The Heyday of Sichuan Cuisine</h2>
        <p>The Tang Dynasty was prosperous, the country was prosperous, the society was stable, the economy was prosperous, and the culture was prosperous. Sichuan cuisine was already well-known in the court. The Sichuan cuisine culture has also stepped out of the Sichuan Basin, and large and small Sichuan restaurants have opened. Sichuan cuisine quickly became popular in many cities.</p>
        <p>During the Song Dynasty, Sichuan cuisine had formed an independent cuisine, and "Sichuan food restaurants" spread all over the streets and alleys of Kaifeng and Lin'an. The emergence of Sichuan restaurants has thriving, breaking the urban diet structure that divides the north and the south, and forms a new situation in which the southern food, the northern food and the Sichuan restaurant are divided into three.</p>
		<p>Because of the long history it has, a museum has formed to give brief introduction for people who wants to know more about it. Chuançais Museum located in Chengdu city capital of Sichuan.</p>
